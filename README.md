👋 Hi, I am Ahmed Kamal. I am an enthusiastic software engineer with knowledge in Domains like embedded systems, Full Stack Development (MERN).

👀 My repository is specialized in these tracks:
- Embedded and Edge Architectures
- Full Stack Development

### My Work Experience Timeline Summary

2025-2026. career break (military service)
2024-2025. SEITech Intern, Graduation Project
2022-2024. participated in Metal Monsters – Combat robot, SUMO, Linefollower Competitions
2020-2022. participated in EVER, SHELL, GEVC Racing Competitions.

### My Skill Set
Programming Language. I'm fluent in speaking embedded C and C++ (especially the modern version like C++11, C++17, and C++20). Also able to speak Python and javascript.
Firmware Architecture Design. A very important step that many engineers missed. Without proper architecture design, your firmware will be destined to be super-hard to maintain and add features.
Firmware Documentation. Without proper documentation, people will waste time to understand and follow your firmware.
